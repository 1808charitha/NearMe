    <h3 align="left">Horsley Hills or Horsleykonda or Yenugulla Mallamma Konda is a series of hills in Andhra Pradesh in Madanapalle Taluka of Annamayya district and is about 9 miles from Madanapalle town. </h3>
    <h3 align="left"> The local name of the hill was Yenugu Mallama Konda after a legend of a saintly old woman named Mallamma who lived at the top of the hill and was fed by elephants (yenugulu). W.D. Horsley, a British collector, built his home around 1870 after whom it is named.</h3>
    <h3 align="left">In contrast to the dry and hot surrounding, this area is well vegetated with cooler climate. </h3>
